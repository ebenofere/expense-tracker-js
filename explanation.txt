localStorage.getItem('transactions'): This part retrieves the value stored in the browser's local storage under the key 'transactions'. The localStorage object in browsers provides a simple key-value store that persists even after the user closes or refreshes the browser.

JSON.parse(...): The retrieved value from local storage is expected to be a string (because localStorage stores values as strings). JSON.parse(...) is used to convert this JSON-formatted string into a JavaScript object. This assumes that the data stored under the 'transactions' key is a valid JSON string.

const localStorageTransactions = ...: The parsed JSON data is then stored in the variable localStorageTransactions. This variable will now hold the data that was previously stored under the 'transactions' key in the local storage, and you can use it as a JavaScript object in your code.
